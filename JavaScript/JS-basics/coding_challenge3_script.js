* CODING CHALLENGE 3

/*
John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were 
$124, $48 and $268.

To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to 
tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 
10% if the bill is more than $200.

In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

function tipCalculator(bills) {
    var tips = [];
    var finalPaidAmount = [];

    for (var i = 0; i < bills.length; i++) {
        if (bills[i] < 50) {
            tips[i] = bills[i] * (20/100);
            finalPaidAmount[i] = bills[i] + tips[i];

        } else if (bills[i] >= 50 && bills [i] < 200) {
            tips[i] = bills[i] * (15/100);
            finalPaidAmount[i] = bills[i] + tips[i];
        }
            else if (bills[i] >= 200) {
                tips[i] = bills[i] * (10/100);
                finalPaidAmount[i] = bills[i] + tips[i];
        }
    }
    console.log(finalPaidAmount, tips);
    return finalPaidAmount, tips;
